# JX-GS
Airfoil family for fast F3F style slope gliders

### Description

The airfoils were designed using [Xoptfoil-JX](https://github.com/jxjo/Xoptfoil-JX/) with the focus on low ca at lower cl (0-0.4).
Special care was taken to cover the more turbulent flow close to ground level.
Because of the relative small camber value, the usage of flaps is mandatory to achieve full performance.

The airfoil family allows to design a complete wing typically in a span range of 2m-3.5m. The span position of an airfoil can be calculated via the the design value of RE*Sqrt(cl).

| Airfoil      | Thickness      | Camber         | Re*Sqrt(cl) |
| :---:        |     :---       |   :---         |  ---:       |
| JX-GS-15     | 7.6% at 27,7%  | 1.46% at 40.0% |  150k       |
| JX-GS-10     | 7.4% at 26.8%  | 1.47% at 36.1% |  100k       |
| JX-GS-06     | 7.1% at 25.0%  | 1.47% at 32.3% |   60k       |
| JX-GS-04     | 6.9% at 23.9%  | 1.48% at 30.7% |   40k       |

The subdirectory [strak](strak/) includes more airfoils in steps of Re*sqrt(cl)=10.000 which were generated by 'blending' the above main airfoils.  

More background infos to the JX-GS family can be found on [RC-Network](https://www.rc-network.de/threads/entwicklung-eines-f3f-profils.787618/post-11919778) (sorry, in German).

### Calculation of Re*Sqrt(cl)
The value of Re*Sqrt(cl), which equals to the fixed lift T2 polar, can be easly calculated with the approximation formula

`Re*Sqrt(cl) = 900 * l * sqrt(Ws)` with `l  chord length [cm]` and `Ws wing load    [g/dm²]`

Example: 
A wing with a wing load of 70 g/dm² will have at chord length 20cm a value of:
Re*sqrt(cl) = 900 * 20 * sqrt(70) = 150000.
So airfoil JX-GS-15 would be a good choice at this section.
