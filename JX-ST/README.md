# JX-ST

The JX-ST airfoil family (or 'strak') focuses on speed-oriented, dynamic flying for wings with a higher wing loading and a higher aspect ratio, which is typically found in scale gliders.

The strak can be applied to wings having a wing span from 3m to 6m and a wing load of 60 - 80g/dm². When used at the right wing sections, a harmonious distribution of lift, drag and moment will be achieved.
 
Flaps are recommended to achieve optimal glide ratio, thermaling performance, and overall best results.

All airfoils were generated by [Xoptfoil2](https://github.com/jxjo/Xoptfoil2) as the airfoil optimizer, with [AirfoilEditor](https://github.com/jxjo/AirfoilEditor) serving as the workbench. 

## Summary

## Airfoil Design 

This chapter will give a brief description of the approach of the design of the JX-ST airfoil family.

### Flight Envelope 

The first step is to define the Reynolds number and lift coefficient range in which the airfoil will primarily operate.
The following parameters are determined:
 - Re·√Cl, which corresponds to the Type 2 polar (constant lift polar) - static flight
 - Reynolds number range in which the airfoil will be operated dynamically
 - Lift coefficient range in which the airfoil will primarily operate


#### Re·√Cl

The airfoil primarily targets wings with a higher wing loading of 60-80 g/dm² and a higher aspect ratio with a root chord of 180-230 mm. 
With these initial parameters, the value of Re·√Cl is determined, which characterizes the constant lift polar (Type 2 polar).


<img src="images/JX-ST-150_design_Re_sqrt.png"  width="500">

The value of Re·√Cl can also be easily calculated using the approximation formula:

`Re·√Cl = 900 · l · √Ws` where `l` = chord [cm], `Ws` = wing load [g/dm²]

For the new airfoil family the main airfoil will be designed for Re·√Cl = 150,000 and named **JX-ST-150**.


#### Re Number and Lift Coefficient

Based on a chord of 200 mm, the Reynolds numbers can be calculated assuming typical flight speeds.
The corresponding flight lift coefficient Cl can be derived from Re√Cl = 150k, which was determined in the previous step. 

| Speed   | Reynolds  | Cl    |  Remarks     
| :---    |   :---    |  :--- | :---      |
| 15 m/s  | 200k      | 0.56  | Relaxed gliding at mid-high lift coefficient    |
| 45 m/s  | 600k      | 0.06  | High-speed flight at very low lift coefficient |

These operating conditions form the basis for the airfoil optimization described below. The primary optimization uses a Type 1 polar (constant speed) at Re=600k, while an additional Type 1 polar at Re=200k ensures good performance characteristics at lower speeds.

Notably, the airfoil operates at very low lift coefficients during high-speed flight, which poses specific aerodynamic challenges for the optimization process.

### Dynamic Flight

To understand the requirements for optimal dynamic flight performance, we must examine how dynamic flight maneuvers impose specific demands on the airfoil's aerodynamic characteristics.

The diagram below illustrates a simple acceleration maneuver: the glider dives from altitude and exits the maneuver at high speed. Throughout this sequence, the wing operates across a wide range of speeds and lift coefficients.

The overlaid polar diagram of the root airfoil visualizes this same maneuver as a path through the drag polar. 

<img src="images/dynamic_flight_acceleration.png"  width="700">

The critical phase is the start of acceleration (point 2 in the diagram). Here, at low Reynolds numbers, the airfoil enters a regime of very low lift coefficients. While the airfoil is designed for much higher Reynolds numbers at low Cl, it experiences significant flow separation and high drag in this condition. This makes the airfoil resist acceleration.

The optimization goal is therefore to design an airfoil that maintains acceptable drag coefficients at the combination of low Reynolds numbers and low Cl values.

During the pullout from the dive to level flight (point 4 in the diagram), the airfoil operates at constant high Reynolds numbers while the lift coefficient transitions from very low Cl through high Cl and back again.


### Base Airfoil JX-GT3-100

The optimization process doesn't start from scratch but rather uses an existing airfoil that already possesses good fundamental aerodynamic properties. 

In this case, the [JX-GT3-100 airfoil](https://github.com/jxjo/Airfoils/tree/main/JX-GT) serves as the starting point, featuring a thickness of 7.7% and camber of 1.7%. 
Although the new JX-ST strak is designed for use with flaps, the base airfoil's camber is increased to 2% to accommodate the higher wing loading of 60-80g/dm². 


### Thickness Considerations

To determine the optimal thickness for the new airfoil, a comparative analysis was conducted. The diagram below shows the same airfoil at three different thickness ratios (7%, 9%, and 11%) while maintaining a constant camber of 2%.

<img src="images/thickness_speed.png"  width="900">

The 7% thick airfoil exhibits excellent minimum drag at approximately cl=0.15, but experiences a sharp drag increase at lift coefficients below cl=0.1.

This behavior is caused by the airfoil's lower surface geometry. At this thickness combined with higher camber, the lower surface lacks sufficient "belly". At negative angles of attack, this causes the flow to decelerate too rapidly, triggering premature laminar-to-turbulent transition.

The 9% thick airfoil shows a slightly higher minimum drag, but maintains significantly lower drag at cl<0.1, making it more suitable for high-speed flight.

Further increasing thickness to 11% raises drag across the entire lift coefficient range without providing any aerodynamic benefits.
Conclusion: An airfoil that is too thin is counterproductive for high-speed flight. The guiding principle for thickness selection is: as thick as necessary, as thin as possible. 

Further investigations showed that 9% thickness for the main airfoil provides a good compromise between aerodynamic performance and structural requirements.

While constructing a high aspect ratio wing with an airfoil of just 9% thickness presents structural challenges, modern composite materials (carbon fiber) should make this readily achievable with adequate strength and stiffness.

### Reference Airfoil SA7036 modified

To benchmark the performance of the new airfoil, the well-established SA7036 airfoil was selected as a reference. Like the JX-GT3-100 base airfoil, it was modified to 9% thickness and 2% camber for direct comparison.

The analysis revealed that the modified SA7036 already approaches the performance targets, with only minor improvements achievable:
- The SA7036 is optimized for higher Reynolds numbers, resulting in weaker performance at lower Reynolds numbers (see section "Dynamic Flight")
- The polar curve shows slight irregularities in the higher cl range, and the maximum angle of attack (alpha_max) could be increased
- High-speed flight characteristics offer some room for improvement

Geometrically, the two modified airfoils JX-GT3-100 and SA7036 exhibit very similar shapes...

## Airfoil Optimization

Airfoil optimization is performed using [Xoptfoil2](https://github.com/jxjo/Xoptfoil2), which is integrated into the [AirfoilEditor](https://github.com/jxjo/AirfoilEditor) environment. The base airfoil is modified according to the defined optimization objectives.

### Shape Function and Geometric Aspects 

The airfoil geometry is represented by two Bezier curves, one for the upper and one for the lower surface, each defined by 7 control points.

The first and last control points are fixed, defining the leading edge (LE) and trailing edge (TE). The second control point defines the perpendicular starting tangent at the leading edge. This parameterization results in 9 design variables per Bezier curve that are subject to optimization. 
An additional constraint is applied at the leading edge, where the curvature of both Bezier curves must be equal to achieve C2 continuity (smooth curvature transition).

On the lower surface, the curvature may have one reversal, resulting in a so-called rear-loaded airfoil with a concave surface toward the trailing edge.

A thickness of 9% will be part of the optimization targets.

### Operating Conditions 

The optimization objectives are defined on a Type 1 polar (constant speed) at Re=600k. 
To ensure the required good acceleration characteristics, an additional Type 1 polar at Re=200k is evaluated.

A value of ncrit=9 is applied, representing a moderate turbulence level.

### Operating Points 

The optimization objectives are defined by operating points, each specifying a target value for aerodynamic parameters such as drag coefficient (cd) that the optimizer should achieve.
Since Bezier curves are inherently smooth, no additional operating points are required to prevent surface bumps or artifacts.

The following diagram shows the final airfoil design of the optimisation together with the target operating points and the resulting polars.

A brief description of the operating points and their role in the overall optimization:

<table>
<tr>
<td>op&nbsp;1</td>
<td>Helper point to achieve low cd at negative cl under the regime of the main targets</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>op&nbsp;2</td>
<td>Controls cd close to cl=0 (high speed flight). As this target requires late laminar-turbulent transition on the lower surface, this point conflicts with operating points 5 and 6, which favor significant rear-loading that limits the laminar run length. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>op&nbsp;3</td>
<td>Helper point at Re=200k to limit drag increase through laminar separation bubbles at lower cl (needed for good acceleration) </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>op&nbsp;4</td>
<td>Ensures minimum cd, which is primarily determined by the thickness target of 9%. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>op&nbsp;5</td>
<td>Together with 'op 6' defines the glide ratio. The counterpars are 'op 3' (at Re=200k) which wants to have a more bubble ramp upper surface and 'op 2' which limits rear loading of the lower surface. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>op&nbsp;6</td>
<td>Helper point to control the shape of the polar close to maximum glide</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>op&nbsp;7</td>
<td>Determines max glide ratio. Claims more camber which is limited by 'op 2'</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>op&nbsp;8</td>
<td>Defines maximum angle of attack and maximum cl. Claims more camber and a large leading edge radius to reduce leading-edge suction peak. This conflicts with minimized cd at low cl.</td>
</tr>
</table>

The airfoil optimization process requires several iterations to find a good balance between the conflicting operating points.
To achieve this balance, each operating point can be assigned an individual weighting within the objective function, or its target value can be relaxed to be less stringent.

### Airfoil Family

After the development of the main airfoil JX-ST-150 was completed, two additional airfoils were developed following the same methodology. These airfoils possess similar aerodynamic characteristics but are designed for different Reynolds number ranges:

**JX-ST-100** for Re√Cl=100, optimized at Re=400k.  
**JX-ST-200** for Re√Cl=200, optimized at Re=800k.  

The three airfoils share a nearly identical alpha_max and cl_max, which enables the design of wings with a nearly elliptical lift distribution and sufficient lift reserves.

The fourth airfoil plays a special role, as it was designed for the wing tip:

**JX-ST-50** for Re√Cl=50, optimized at Re=200k.

This airfoil was optimized less for best aerodynamic performance and more for maintaining good alpha_max at the low Reynolds numbers found at the wing tip.

With this fourth airfoil, the airfoil family is complete:

## Aerodynamic Properties

### Main Airfoil JX-ST-150 

The improvements of the new JX-ST-150 airfoil compared to the modified JX-GT-100 and the modified SA7036 are, as expected, quite modest. Both reference airfoils already possess excellent aerodynamic properties that are close to the physical limits as represented by Xfoil.

Compared to the modified SA7036, the new airfoil has slightly improved high-speed flight characteristics (cl < 0.2), a higher alpha_max, and a smaller drag hump caused by laminar separation bubbles at low Reynolds numbers.

### Airfoil Family JX-ST

The greatest performance improvement is achieved when the JX-ST strak is applied to a wing with Reynolds number-matched airfoils positioned at the appropriate wing sections.

The following polar diagrams show the four airfoils of the JX-ST family at their respective design Reynolds numbers. It is clearly visible how the characteristics of the three main airfoils JX-ST-200, JX-ST-150, and JX-ST-100 are similar, thereby ensuring a harmonious distribution along the wing span.

The tip airfoil maintains reasonably good performance even at its low Reynolds numbers.

## Usage

### Designing a Wing

To design a wing based on the JX-ST strak, first determine the Re√Cl value at the wing root. This determines the root airfoil for the wing, for example JX-ST-170.

The main performance region of the wing extends in the spanwise direction to approximately 60% of the root chord depth. At this position, place the airfoil corresponding to 60% of 170, which equals JX-ST-100.

Finally, position the tip airfoil JX-ST-50 at the wing tip.

These three airfoils are sufficient to design an aerodynamically high-quality wing.

Depending on additional structural requirements, any number of intermediate airfoils can be positioned between these main sections.

For convenience, you will find all intermediate blended airfoils from JX-ST-200 to JX-ST-50 in steps of Re√Cl = 10k in the [blended](blended) directory.

<img src="images/JX-ST_family_blended.png"  width="700">

The value of Re·√Cl can also be easily calculated using the approximation formula:

`Re·√Cl = 900 · l · √Ws` where `l` = chord [cm], `Ws` = wing load [g/dm²]

Example: A wing with a wing load of 70 g/dm² at a chord length of 20 cm will have:
Re·√Cl = 900 × 20 × √70 = 150,000
