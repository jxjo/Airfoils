# JX-Fe
Symmetrical airfoil family for tailplane or fin with low drag and small dead band.

### Description

The airfoils were designed using [Xoptfoil-JX](https://github.com/jxjo/Xoptfoil-JX/) with the focus on low drag, small dead band and a robust alpha max.

| :---         |     :---        |   :---         |
